# manpage-elastic
Inspired by [iridakos's tutorial](https://iridakos.com/tutorials/2018/04/12/elasticsearch-linux-man-pages.html), but ported to Go with additional features.

## Additional Features
* Concurrent indexes with configurable number of goroutines
* Commandline flags to force creation of an index and do health checks
